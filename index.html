                    <h2>What is Git?</h2>
                    <p>Git is a distributed version control system. <b>Huh?</b> Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. Git Allows you to work on a project, making changes, without anything you do being irreversible. The user knows what happened and when it happened as well as who did it. Git allows for collaboration. Unlike other version control system Git is local.</p>

                    <h2>Who should use Git?</h2>
                    <p>Git isn't just for those who like to write code. Git should be used by anyone who needs to keep track of changes throughout time. If you could use Git. Even if what you are working on is not plain text, you cans till use Git, you may not find such a huge benefit of doing so. Instead of Git you could get away with saving as a new file when you have made an important change.</p>

                    <h2>Why can't I use <span class="hbold">x</span> instead?</h2>
                    <p>Git has several advantages over other version control systems. Lets compare it to it's closest rival, Subversion (SVN)!</p>
                    <p>Because Git is local, unlike Subversion everything is faster. Git is also very reliable, you don't have to worry about Git doing it's job. It is also impossible to change any file, date, commit message, or any other data in a Git repository without Git knowing about it.</p>
